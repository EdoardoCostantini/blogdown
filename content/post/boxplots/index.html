<h2>Reading a boxplot</h2>
<p>Boxplots are descriptive tools to visualize the distribution of variables with a focus on their measures of spread and center.
A boxplots report in the same figure the median, the 1st and 3rd quartiles, and indicate possible outliers.</p>
<p>Imagine wanting to plot the distribution of age in a court of students enrolled in a master program at a university.
The age of the students is likely to be normally distributed around a mean of 26.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Set up ----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Set seed
set.seed(20220906)

# Generate some age variable for a university master programme
age &lt;- round(rnorm(1e3, mean = 26, sd = 2), 0)</code></pre>
<p>Then, we can create the boxplot of this age variable in R by using the <code>boxplot()</code> function.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Look at the boxplot ---------------------------------------------------------
boxplot(age)</code></pre>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/boxplot-explained-1.png" width="720" /></p>
<p>The variable age is centered around 26 and 50% of the distribution is located between 25 (1st quartile) and 27 (3rd quartile).
There are 6 values that represent possible outliers (the circles outside the whiskers).</p>

<h2>Play around with boxplots</h2>
<p>You can compute the statistics used to draw the boxplot explicitly by following this code:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Compute boxplot statistics manually ------------------------------------------

# Compute the median
med &lt;- median(age)

# Compute 1st and 3rd quartiles
qnt &lt;- quantile(age, probs = c(.25, .75))

# Compute interquartile range
IQR &lt;- diff(qnt)[[1]]

# Compute fences/whisker bounds
C &lt;- 1.5 # range multiplier
fences &lt;- c(lwr = qnt[[1]] - C * IQR, upr = qnt[[2]] + C * IQR)

# Put together the boxplot stats
bxstats &lt;- sort(c(med = med, qnt, f = fences))

# Compute boxplot statistics with R function
bxstats_auto &lt;- boxplot.stats(age, coef = C)$stats

# Compare results obtain manually and with the R function
data.frame(manual = bxstats, R.function = bxstats_auto)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##       manual R.function
## f.lwr     22         22
## 25%       25         25
## med       26         26
## 75%       27         27
## f.upr     30         30</code></pre>
<p>You can visualize the impact of different choices for the range multiplier <code>C</code>.
In the following pictures, you can see that a larger <code>C</code> is less restrictive in which values are considered outliers.</p>
