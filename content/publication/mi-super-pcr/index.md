abstract: Multiple imputation by chained equations requires defining a univariate imputation model for every variable under imputation. This can be a daunting task, especially with large social surveys with many variables. In this work, we compare different ways of using principal component regressions (PCR) to bypass this decision. In particular, we explore whether different supervision approaches to PCR can improve the imputation performance.
summary: This is some summary.
