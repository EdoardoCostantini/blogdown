# Introduction

The EM algorithm was described in -LINK TO OTHER POST-
We will use the sweep operator described in -LINK TO OTHER POST-

Little and Rubin [-@littleRubin:2002 p148] defined it as follows:

# Learn by coding

# TL;DR, just give me the code!
```{r TLDR, ref.label = knitr::all_labels(), echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
```
